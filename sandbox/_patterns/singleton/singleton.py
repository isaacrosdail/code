# Singleton Pattern: "There can only be one."
# A type of Creational Pattern
# Singley great for: Shared source of truth.

# "sucks until it's really awesome"
# Global mutable state creates hidden coupling, makes tests order-dependent, and turns
# change into cross-cutting risk.
# Granted, when you WANT this behavior, you REALLY want it.
